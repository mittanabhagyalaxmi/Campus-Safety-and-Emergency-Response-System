Campus Safety and Emergency Response System

📌 Project Overview
The Campus Safety and Emergency Response System is designed to enhance student safety by providing quick communication, live location sharing, and intelligent video-based crowd detection during emergencies.
It allows students to send alerts, share their location, and automatically trigger emergency calls/messages if a dangerous situation is detected.

✨ Features

📍 Emergency Alert Button
Sends WhatsApp messages and live location to multiple emergency contacts instantly.

🎥 Video Upload with Crowd Detection
Users can upload videos. If the video detects 15+ people (crowd), the system triggers emergency alerts automatically.

📞 Automated Call & WhatsApp Alert
Calls and messages are sent to campus security and predefined contacts using Twilio API.

🌍 Live Location Sharing
Student location is shared during emergencies for faster response.
